What's Goslings
---------------
Goslings visualizes a Git repository.

A Git repository consists of objects, references, and an index.

* Object
    * Blob: Represents a file, and contains the entire contents of the file.
    * Tree: Represents a directory, and contains pointers to other trees and blobs.
    * Commit: Represents a commit, and contains pointers to the parent commits and a pointer to a tree which represents the project's root directory.
    * Annotated Tag: Represents an annotation of a tag, and contains a pointer to a commit.
* Reference
    * Branch: A pointer to a commit.
    * Tag: A pointer to a commit or a tag object.
    * Symbolic Reference: A pointer to a branch or commit.
* Index: A structure containing paths to files and pointers to blobs.

Understanding this repository architecture helps you to master Git.
Goslings was created as a tool to learn the architecture.

Download
--------

You can download Goslings from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/kaitoy/goslings/releases)

Build
-----
1. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and JDK 8+.
2. Download the project by `git clone --recursive https://github.com/kaitoy/goslings.git`.
3. In the project root directory, run `./gradlew build`.

How to Use
----------
JRE 8+ is required to run Goslings server.

Run `java -jar goslings/goslings-server/build/libs/goslings-server-0.0.1.jar --server.port 80` to start Goslings server.
After the startup completes, open `http://localhost` by a Web browser. You will see Goslings GUI like below:

![goslings-form](https://github.com/kaitoy/goslings/raw/master/www/images/goslings-form.png)

In the GUI, enter the path to or the URL of a Git repository (e.g. `C:\tmp\goslings\.git`, `/tmp/goslings/.git`, `https://github.com/kaitoy/goslings.git`, etc.)
and press the `Browse` button.
Then, Goslings server creates a symlink (if local) or a clone (if remote) of the repository into the working directory `goslings` in the tmp directory which `java.io.tmpdir` points to,
and shows the Git [objects](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects) and [references](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects) like below:

* Legend:
    * Pink Circle   : Commit
    * Green Triangle: Tree
    * Purple Box    : Blob
    * Red Diamond   : Tag Object
    * Blue Box      : (Symbolic) Reference
    * Green Box     : Index

* Operations
    * Use your mouse wheel to zoom in and out.
    * Drag and drop an object, a reference, or the index to move it.
    * Drag and drop the background to slide the view.
    * Single click on an object, a reference, or the index shows its contents.
    * And double click on a commit or a tree shows trees and blobs under it.

* Configurations
    * `com.github.kaitoy.goslings.server.reposDir`: Set this property to change the path of the working directory.
    * `com.github.kaitoy.goslings.server.uriPrefix`: If this property is set, the Goslings server returns an error for a repository URI which doesn't start with the value of the property.
